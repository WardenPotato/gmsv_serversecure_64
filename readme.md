=================

A module for Garry's Mod that mitigates exploits on the Source engine.

## Info

Mac was not tested at all (sorry but I'm cheap and lazy).

If stuff starts erroring or fails to work, be sure to check the correct line endings (\n and such) are present in the files for each OS.

This project requires garrysmod_common (https://bitbucket.org/danielga/garrysmod_common), a framework to facilitate the creation of compilations files (Visual Studio, make, XCode, etc). Simply set the environment variable 'GARRYSMOD_COMMON' or the premake option 'gmcommon' to the path of your local copy of garrysmod_common. We also use the SourceSDK, so set the environment variable 'SOURCE_SDK' or the premake option 'sourcesdk' to the path of your local copy of the SourceSDK (SourceSDK2013 is recommended, https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013).
